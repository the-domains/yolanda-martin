  The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and
  maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what
  photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale
  portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a
  collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness"
  plaguing the area.
